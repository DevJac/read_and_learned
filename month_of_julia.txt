Day 1
-----------------

The evaluation of an expression is automatically printed unless you end the line
with a `;`.

`ans` refers to the value of the last expression.

Type `?` at the prompt will activate help mode.

Staring a line with `;` make it a shell command.

Pressing `ctrl+r` activates an awesome search through the command history.
This also work in the regular system shell!

`ctrl+l` clears the console. This also works in the regular system shell!

There are lots of escape codes and special characters available in Julia, see:
https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/doc/manual/unicode-input-table.rst

`x\^2` followed by tab will print "X squared" in a nice unicodey format.
`x\_2` followed by tab will create a subscript 2.

Day 2
-----------------------------

There is an Atom IDE for Julia named uber-juno. I had to install `cmake` to get
this Atom plugin to install properly.

Juno features:
  Press `ctrl+enter` to evaluate a line.
  Press `ctrl+space` for autocomplete.

There is also an Jupyter plugin for Julia.

Day 3
--------------------

Variables work as expected:
  a = 1
  b = c = d = 2
  e, f = 3, 4

Julia has compound expressions with 2 syntaxes:
  x = begin
      a = 1
      b = 2
      a + b
  end

  x = (a = 1; b = 2; a + b)

`const v = 1` makes it so the type of `v` cannot change. The value can change,
but a warning will be issued if it does.

`typeof(x)` gives you the type of `x`.
`Any` is at the root of the type hierarchy.
`isa(x, Type)` returns true if `x` is a subtype of `Type`.
`super(Type)` gives the supertype of `Type`. `subtypes` is the opposite function.

Some of Julia's numeric types:
  Int8
  Int32
  Int64
  UInt64
  Float64
  BigInt
  BigFloat
  Complex

Strings are immutable. There is ASCIIString and UTF8String. I think I saw that
this will change in a github issue, and that the two String types will be
unified.

Julia strings are indexed starting with 1. `end` is a special variable that
refers to the ending index of a String.

Regex strings are of the form `r"a regex"i`. Regex related functions are:
  ismatch
  match

Type conversion can use the `convert` function, or a lower-cased type function.
