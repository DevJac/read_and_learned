Why is the command line useful in the age of Python, R, Spark, etc?
  The command line is old and very stable. It has withstood the test of time,
  and may outlive Python, R, and Spark. It is available almost everywhere. It
  is very close to the file system, which is where the data we care about is
  stored.

Data Science is "OSEMN".
  - Obtain data
  - Scrub data
    - In “Data Jujitsu,” DJ Patil states that “80% of the work in any data project is in cleaning the data”.
  - Explore data
  - Model data
  - iNterpret data

New command line tools I learned:
  tree
  less
    Use `-R` command to turn color codes into color

Command lines can be extended with `\` or `|`.

A shell function looks like this: `fac() { (echo 1; seq $1) | paste -s -d\* | bc; }`
Shell arguments are referenced by `$1`, etc.

The output of a command-line tool is by default passed on to the terminal,
which displays it on our screen.

`command > file` creates or overwrites file with the output of command.
`command >> file` append to the file, it will create the file if needed.

`< file command` pipes the file into the command.

`help` is like `man` for builtin shell commands. E.g. `help cd`

New command line tools I learned:
  bc - a calculator language
  paste - merge lines of files
  seq - print a sequence of numbers
  type - determine the type of a command
