What does this notation mean?

argmax_a f(a)
*** Answer
a value of a at which f(a) takes its maximal value

* Chapter 1 - The Reinforcement Learning Problem
** Notes
*** Elements of Reinforcement Learning
**** policy
"A policy defines the learning agentâ€™s way of behaving at a given time. Roughly
speaking, a policy is a mapping from perceived states of the environment to actions to
be taken when in those states."
**** reward signal
"A reward signal defines the goal in a reinforcement learning problem. On each time
step, the environment sends to the reinforcement learning agent a single number, a
reward."
**** value function
"Whereas the reward signal indicates what is good in an immediate sense, a value
function specifies what is good in the long run. Roughly speaking, the value of
a state is the total amount of reward an agent can expect to accumulate over the
future, starting from that state."
