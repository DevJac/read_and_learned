Verified Functional Programming in Agda
  by Aaron Stump

-----------------------------
Preface
-----------------------------

"This book is about a new way to program, where instead of just testing programs
on a finite number of inputs, we write mathematical proofs that demonstrate their
correctness on all possible inputs."

"Agda is, in some ways, the most advanced functional programming language in
existence, and so if you learn how to program in Agda, you will have a very strong
foundation for programming in other languages that use the idioms of functional
programming."

--------------------------
Chapter 1 - Booleans
--------------------------

Needed Atom packages:
  agda-language
  agda-mode

Ctrl-C Ctrl-L type checks the current file in Atom agda-mode.
Ctrl-C Ctrl-D lets you evaluate the type of an expression.
Ctrl-C Ctrl-N lets you evaluate an expression.

Agda imports:
  import something
  open import something
The "open" keyword means that you don't have to qualify the names in something.

-- Agda comment.
{- Agda comment. -}

Booleans have the type Set. `Set` has the type `Set 1` and so on.

{-# this is a compiler directive #-}

Agda has an `infixr` like Haskell, and declares the precedence and associativity
like Haskell.

Operators and operands must be separated by spaces. This is because Agda allows
such flexibility in operator names.

Dot, semicolons, and parenthesis are special characters that cannot appear in
variable names.

In Atom, the View menu contains developer tools that let you edit CSS and change
the style of the editor. You can increase the font in the agda-mode bottom
panels by editing styles.less in your ~/.atom directory. The "fonts" package in
Atom is also really useful for customizing the look.

In an Agda type signature, Agda will try to infer the type of variables in curly
braces.

If types A and B both have types Set 0, then (A -> B) will also have type Set 0.

Chapter 2
-------------------------------

`~ ~ tt \== tt` is a type; the type is Set.
`~~tt : ~ ~ tt \== tt` is a proof named `~~t`.

```
~~b : ‚àÄ (b : ùîπ) ‚Üí ~ ~ b ‚â° b
~~b tt = refl
~~b ff = refl
```
In the above example proof:
  `refl` is "reflection", it is used when two forms evaluate to the same thing.
  In this case `~ ~ tt` evaluates to `tt`, and thus `tt ‚â° tt`.
  The pattern matching in this function is sometimes called "pattern refinement".

`?` is used for type holes. The agda-mode in Atom will help fill in the holes.

```
~~b : ‚àÄ {b} ‚Üí ~ ~ b ‚â° b
~~b {b = tt} = refl
~~b {b = ff} = refl
```
In the above example proof:
  `b` is made an implicit argument.
  Note the curly brace notation. Note that curly braces support named arguments.

```
||‚â°ff‚ÇÅ : ‚àÄ {b1 b2} ‚Üí b1 || b2 ‚â° ff ‚Üí b1 ‚â° ff
||‚â°ff‚ÇÅ {ff} p = refl
||‚â°ff‚ÇÅ {tt} ()
```
In the above proof:
  The first argument of the function must always be type var "declarations"? (This is just a guess.)
  `()` is the "absurd pattern". That function doesn't need a definition because
  it is an absurd case, I don't know the details, but if `b1` is `tt` then what
  we are trying to prove is that tt == ff, which is absurd.

`refl` is the only way to construct an equality proof.

You cannot refine non-variable types equal to other non-variable types.

A "dot pattern" is where you put a dot (.) in front of a type variable in
curly braces. This tells Agda that the stuff in the curly braces is not a
subpattern to match on, but rather, has a form with is dictated by the entire
pattern.

"In general, rewrite works as follows in Agda. Suppose you have a proof p of
some equation X ‚â° Y. The proof p is simply any expression which has X ‚â° Y
as its type; it does not have to be a variable, but could be a call to a lemma that
has already been proved, for example. Then rewrite p instructs the Agda type
checker to look in the goal for any occurrences of X, and transform those into Y.
X and Y could be complex expressions; they do not have to be just variables."

`‚àÄ` seems to appear in any term that introduces a new type variable.
`‚â°` is used to express the "equality type".

Two expressions are definitionally equal in Agda if they can be proved equal
using their defining equations. `refl` can be used to prove these.

Pattern matching can instantiate universally quantified variables which ap-
pear in the type. This has the effect of specializing the desired formula to the
specific instances of those variables.

Assumptions in theorems are just treated as extra arguments to the programs
which are serving as proofs of those theorems.

If you use refl as the pattern for an equality assumption t ‚úë t‚Äô, Agda
will try to refine the type by making t and t‚Äô definitionally equal. This will
fail unless one of these expressions is definitionally equal to a [naked type] variable.

Chapter 3 - Numbers
-------------------------------

```
data ‚Ñï : Set where
  zero : ‚Ñï
  suc : ‚Ñï ‚Üí ‚Ñï

{-# BUILTIN NATURAL ‚Ñï #-}
```
Above is a definition of the "Peano numbers" in Agda. The comment is a compiler
directive to automatically consider, e.g., "2" with `suc (suc zero)`.

All functions must provably terminate in Agda. One way to do this is for all
recursive calls to operate on a "structurally smaller" input. For example, addition:
  _+_ : ‚Ñï ‚Üí ‚Ñï ‚Üí ‚Ñï
  zero  + n = n
  suc m + n = suc (m + n)
The definition of addition is pulling uses of suc from the first summand out, until
they have all been removed and the first summand is just zero.

Rewrite is a key-word? Is it built into the language?

In `f a rewrite b`:
  f is a function.
  a is a pattern match
  rewrite is a keyword built into the language (I think?)
  b must be of the form `x ‚â° y`, it will rewrite x to be y in the left equation

Ctrl-C Ctrl-, (comma) will display the normalized goal of the current selected
hole. You will also see any applicable assumptions, which are called the "context."

Useful commands in Atom agda-mode (`c,` means Ctrl-c Ctrl-,):
  c, -- display info about selected hole
  c. -- display info about selected hole
  u -- no normalization prefix
  uu -- full normalization prefix
  uuc, -- display info about selected hole with full normalization
  ca -- attempt to automatically fill in the hole
  cr -- try the current hole value, if it succeeds, remove the hole
  cf -- next hole
  cb -- previous hole
  cc -- pick a type, and then pattern match on all possible values

`refl` and `_‚â°_` are "builtins".

```
+assoc : ‚àÄ (a b c : ‚Ñï) ‚Üí a + (b + c) ‚â° (a + b) + c
+assoc zero b c = refl
+assoc (suc a) b c rewrite +assoc a b c = refl
```
I made the following comments about how `rewrite` works here:
  {-
  So `rewrite +assoc a b c` is a rewrite directive saying that
  `a + (b + c)` can be rewritten as `(a + b) + c`. Apparently `rewrite` can be used
  with any `_‚â°_` equation, so this is valid.

  The goal function is: suc (a + (b + c)) ‚â° suc ((a + b) + c)
  When we apply the rewrite directive we get:
    suc ((a + b) + c) ‚â° suc ((a + b) + c)

  These are exactly equal. QED.
  -}

Q.E.D. is an initialism of the Latin phrase "quod erat demonstrandum", meaning "which is what had to be proven".

Multiple rewrites can be separated by a pipe `|`.

I implemented the following function myself with minimal help from the book:
  *distribr : ‚àÄ (a b c : ‚Ñï) ‚Üí (a + b) * c ‚â° (a * c) + (b * c)
  *distribr zero b c = refl
  *distribr (suc a) b c rewrite *distribr a b c = +assoc c (a * c) (b * c)
