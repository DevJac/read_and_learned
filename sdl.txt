Lesson 01 - 07

You must first initialize SDL. There are various init flags like: video, audio,
events, input, etc.

SDL surfaces are software rendered.

"Blitting" takes a surface and stamps it onto another surface.

SDL is doubled buffered (at least sometimes, maybe not all the time), and you
draw or "blit" to the inactive buffer. When reader to show the next frame call
SDL_UpdateWindowSurface.

SDL keeps an event queue you poll.

SDL Textures work with SDL Renderers. SDL Surfaces work with SDL Windows, though
I'm unsure about this latter statement, it appears to be the case from the
examples I've seen.

SDL_RenderCopy is like blitting for Textures.
SDL_RenderPresent updates the screen.
